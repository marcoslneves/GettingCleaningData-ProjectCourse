Getting And Cleaning Data - Course Project
=========================================

### Description

This repo contains my final project to Coursera Course "Getting And Cleaning Data" that is part of Data Sciencist Specialization.  
There is just one single script called `run_analysis.R` containing all functions and code to do:

1. Download the raw datasets from UCI Repo
2. Read data 
3. Do data transformations to merge, filter and clean 
4. Write a single output tidy data to a TXT file named "./data/UCI_HAR_tidy_data.txt""

The `CodeBook.md` have more detail about the datasets and process.


### Run from command line

1. Clone this repo
2. Run the script:

       $ Rscript run_analysis.R

3. Look for the final dataset at `./data/UCI_HAR_tidy_data.txt`

	   $ head -3 data/UCI_HAR_tidy_data.txt
	   
### Open project with RStudio

This repo also contains the RStudio project file `GettingCleaningData-ProjectCourse.Rproj`
